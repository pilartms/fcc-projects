    <section aria-labelledby="timeline-list" id="legacy">
        <ul class="timeline-list">
            <li><span>1815</span> - Ada Lovelace (Augusta Ada Byron) was born in London, England. She was the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and mathematician Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke.</li>
            <li><span>1824</span> - Lord Byron left England shortly after Ada’s birth, and her parents separated. Her mother, Lady Anne, raised her with an emphasis on mathematics and science to prevent her from becoming a "poet like her father."</li>
            <li><span>1833</span> - Ada met Charles Babbage, an inventor and mathematician, through her tutor Mary Somerville. She was captivated by his concept of the Difference Engine, an early mechanical calculator."</li>
            <li><span>1835</span> - Ada married William King, who later became the Earl of Lovelace. She then became Countess of Lovelace.</li>
            <li><span>1837</span> - Ada began developing her interests in mathematics and scientific subjects. She maintained an active interest in Babbage’s work on his new invention, the Analytical Engine, an early model for a general-purpose computer.</li>
            <li><span>1842-1843</span> - Ada was asked to translate an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea on the Analytical Engine from French to English. While translating, she added extensive notes, which were three times longer than the original article. Her notes included the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, effectively making her the <span class="bold-text">world’s first computer programmer</span>. She foresaw that such machines could do more than arithmetic, imagining applications in music, art, and beyond.</li>
            <li><span>1843</span> - Her notes were published under the initials <span class="bold-text">A.A.L.</span> in an English scientific journal, describing the potential of the Analytical Engine beyond calculations. This visionary approach set Ada Lovelace apart as a pioneer in computing.</li>
            <li><span>1852</span> - Ada Lovelace died from uterine cancer at the age of 36. She was buried next to her father at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Hucknall, England.</li>

            <li><span>1998</span> - The British Computer Society began awarding the Lovelace Medal for notable contributions to computing.</li>
